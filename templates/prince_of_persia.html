                        <p style="padding-top: 10px;" id="paragraph">Prince of Persia, electronic action-adventure game series, originally developed by the American game company Brøderbund Software in 1989 for Apple Inc.’s Apple II home computer. (Brøderbund was acquired by the Learning Company [a division of Mattel, Inc., an American toy company] in 1998.) The Prince of Persia franchise was later acquired by the French game company Ubisoft Entertainment. Originally designed by the American computer programmer Jordan Mechner, the Prince of Persia franchise boasts nearly a dozen game releases for personal computers (PCs) and various video-game consoles.
                        <p>

                        <p id="paragraph">The original Prince of Persia, which had strong platform game elements, follows the Prince, a character who begins as a beggar on a quest to reach the Princess. The game’s villain, Jaffar, is attempting to rule Persia by rising to power in the Sultan’s absence. In particular, Jaffar plans to marry the Princess in order to become Sultan, but a side-scrolling adventure ensues when the Prince contests that plan. As an additional challenge, the player is on a timer and has only 60 minutes to beat the game. Whenever the Prince dies, he has to restart his current level, or section of the game, and loses time. Prince of Persia kept players entertained with advanced graphics, challenging puzzles, and innovative twists. The original story line ended after two releases in the 1990s, but 2003 saw the release of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time by Ubisoft. The Sands of Time was a hit, scoring high points for graphics and dynamic controls, and it ushered in two popular sequels, The Warrior Within (2004) and The Two Thrones (2005). </p>
                            
                        <p id="paragraph">A graphic novel chronicling the Prince of Persia’s adventures, written by Mechner, was released in 2008. Ubisoft also released Prince of Persia (2008) for PCs and for the Microsoft Corporation’s Xbox 360 and the Sony Corporation’s PlayStation 3 video-game consoles. The game Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands and the film Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time both debuted in May 2010, with Jake Gyllenhaal filling the role of the big-screen prince.</p>

                            <h4>The Sands of Time</h4>
                            <p id="paragraph">In Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince is a brash young man who joins his father, King Sharaman, in the siege of an Indian city. He finds his way inside and steals a dagger. A little later, it’s revealed that the Maharaja’s Vizier had traitorously instigated the attack in order to gain possession of a magical hourglass. When he sees the Prince with the dagger, he demands to be given it. Sharaman refuses, saying that the Prince should hold onto it as a keepsake.</p>

                            <p id="paragraph">    The Vizier then manages to trick the Prince into using the dagger as a key to open the Hourglass. When he does, it releases the eponymous “Sands of Time”, which the Vizier believed to grant immortality. Everyone in the palace is turned into a sand monster with the exception of the Vizier, the Prince, and the Maharaja’s daughter, a princess called Farah. The reason that they didn’t turn was due to magical items: the Vizier had his staff, the Prince had the dagger, and Farah was protected by an amulet. </p>
                                
                            <p id="paragraph">    With the Sands released, it’s up to the Prince to correct his mistake. As in the original game, he has to run, jump, and climb his way through the palace to reach the Vizier. Aside from difficult jumps, where it’s sometimes easy to fall to one’s death, the palace’s defence system has also been activated, meaning that there are various traps that the Prince has to overcome.
                            </p>
                            <p id="paragraph">
                                Fortunately, the dagger turns out to be the “Dagger of Time”, a magical weapon that allows him to rewind time, an ability limited by the number of full sand tanks he has at his disposal. This means that accidentally jumping into a pit with spikes is no longer an automatic game over: you can rewind time and correct the mistake. This feature made it in all of the subsequent Prince of Persia games with the exception of the 2008 reboot, but that entry had its own take on avoiding death that I’ll get to later.</p>


                                <img src= {% static "upload/pop2.jpg" %}  width="100%" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            <h4>A tale of two princes</h4>
                            <p id="paragraph">The <l>Warrior Within</l> was a hit, but also proved divisive. Many people who had played The Sands of Time were understandbly upset about the angrier, more violent tone of the sequel. Newcomers to the series that enjoyed the harsher nature of Warrior Within didn’t care for the lighter tone of the prequel. So when Ubisoft started development of the next game they were faced by a bit of a quandary.</p>

                            <p id="paragraph"> The result is The <l> Two Thrones </l>, which embraced the dual nature of the Prince by essentially creating a mix of the first two games. It picks up where the “good ending” of The Warrior Within left off. The Prince and Kaileena, the “Empress of Time”, are on a boat and within reach of the city of Babylon when they are attacked by an unknown army. Kaileena gets taken and the Prince has to find his way through the beleagured city.</p>
                                
                            <p id="paragraph"> He soon discovers that by undoing the events of the previous games, the Vizier from The Sands of Time is still alive and looking for the mythical Sands. He captures and kills Kaileena, thereby somehow releasing the Sands of Time again. The Prince gets struck by the blast while having a metal whip (a “Daggertail”) wrapped around his arm, and he’s changed as a result: now part sandwraith, at some points during the game he is transformed into the Dark Prince, while an evil voice occassionally prattles inside his head.
